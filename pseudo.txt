TPSO(distributionSystem, contingencyScenarios, customerDamageFunctions, loadData, sectionalizerCost, breakerCost)
    Initialize swarm with random positions and velocities
    Initialize global best solution and fitness
    
    for each iteration:
        for each particle in swarm:
            Calculate particle's fitness using calculateFitness
            Update particle's personal best position and fitness if current fitness is better
            Update global best position and fitness if current fitness is better than global best
            
            find new position and new velocity with updatePosition and updateVelocity
            
            Calculate distances from particle's position to reference angles
            Apply transformation function to distances
            
            Update particle's velocity
            Update particle's position
    
    return global best solution and fitness

calculateFitness(position, distributionSystem)
    Decode position to switch types (none, sectionalizer, breaker)
    Create system with decoded switch types
    
    Initialize total cost to 0
    for each contingency scenario:
        Calculate cost for the contingency using calculateECOSTForContingency
        Add cost to total cost
    
    Calculate investment cost based on switch types and costs
    Return total cost + investment cost

calculateECOSTForContingency(contingency, system)
    Initialize total cost to 0
    Find first breaker and sectionalizer upstream of faulted section
    
    if no breaker found:
        Calculate cost for all load points with repair time
    else if no sectionalizer found:
        Calculate cost for de-energized load points upstream of breaker with repair time
    else:
        Calculate cost for de-energized load points between breaker and sectionalizer with sectionalizer switching time
        Calculate cost for de-energized load points between sectionalizer and faulted section with loop switch switching time
        Calculate cost for remaining faulty zone with repair time
    
    Return total cost
